# AdventOfCode

This is a repository containing *my personal solutions* to the 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) challenges. All challenge files must be
downloaded from the Advent of Code website and to be used without modification must named as `dayN` in
`inputs/2021/` (where `N` is which day of 24 we are at, with a variable digit count).

## License

I am licensing this under the MIT license even though I suggest people not use my solutions. I'd still
consider myself not the best when it comes to programming in general, but I have felt that I've improved.
However, [GeneralUtils](src/main/kotlin/sschr15/aocsolutions/GeneralUtils.kt) might actually have some
good code. Proceed with caution!

## Repository Updates

This repository will be purposely updated a day late compared to the challenges to not spoil challenges
immediately. This is also true about the Part3 challenges as well, but you can join the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/yy4EzJz5rR) if you *really* want to solve them before published here.
