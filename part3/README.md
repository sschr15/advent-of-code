# Part 3

This is a collection of unofficial challenges created by a [Java Discord's](https://discord.gg/yy4EzJz5rR)
staff members. The part 3 files will be found in this directory under the format `dayN` where `N` is what
day (out of 25) that we're currently on.

## Each day's objective

This will be built one day behind as always, but if you want to just see the objective and do it yourself,
here is the list:

1. Given the attached list of ~500,000 numbers, find 3 of them that sum to 3232322, and give the product of those 3 numbers.

More to come...
